# FAZnF3_v1
This project combines state-of-the-art random forest machine learning models (ML) with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical computations to discover promising new hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) to serve as the large band gap semiconductor in tandem solar cells. After attaining a coefficient of determinations of 91% and 85% for band gap and relative energy, respectively, the trained ML models were applied to a set of previously unidentified HOIPs to determine the top candidates that exhibit band gaps around 1.6 - 1.8 eV and high thermochemical stability. DFT computations on formamidinium zinc fluoride (FAZnF3) confirmed its potential applicability as the large band gap catalyst in tandem photoelectrochemical water splitting devices for clean hydrogen production.
